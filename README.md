## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Changed the tip percentage selection to utilize a slider, allowing for more options
* [X] Added a bill split calculator function that displays the cost per person for groups of people

## Notes

Getting familiar with XCode and Swift was my biggest challenge. Because I've almost exclusively coded with Java
in CS educational career, learning a new coding language and figuring out how to use a new IDE was a difficult
but rewarding challenge.
